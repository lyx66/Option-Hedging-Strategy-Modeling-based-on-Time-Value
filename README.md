## Option-Hedging-Strategy-Modeling-based-on-Time-Value
by ***Yingxin LIN***
### Introduce
- Python code for a trading strategy based on ***time value***, which is performed in the *SSE 50ETF* option market of China.
### Strategy
- I apply the time value of options as an indicator, to build a hedging strategy. 
- Specifically, I buy option contracts with large time value and sell option contracts with small time value.
- Every month, I construct portfolios on the first trading day, and then I close portfolios on the last trading day.
### Returns of the strategy
***Fig.1 Cumulative returns of the strategy (compared with SSE 50ETF)***

### Robust Test & Attribution of Strategy
- I divide options into fair value options and imaginary value options, and back-test the strategy on both of them respectively.
- The division is based on `S/K - 1` value (*i.g.* EPS) of each option.

- Comparing *Fig.3* and *Fig.4* below, I find that the return of the strategy mainly comes from virtual options.
